  <p>Hi, my name is Seun Osibona born on 21st January 2003 born in Camden, England yes, I am an Aquarius which describes me exactly to a tee. As you can see my name isn’t like the others, but I am blessed to have such a unique name which means thank you God. I am the middle child which isn’t as bad as everyone seems to portray it to be I have two older sisters and one younger brother. My childhood was always happy and full of joy. I remember always being with my parents and sisters. We would all always stay together, go on holidays, and go out together on weekends. As far as I can remember primary school was the enjoyable part of my education as we had a thing called golden time on Fridays where we were allowed to have a free period in the afternoon and just do whatever we wanted. I remember I enjoyed playing in the kitchen and making my friends pretend food which felt so real. Secondary school was then when I started to mature as this is when it started to get serious with GCSEs and determining whether I wanted to go to college or sixth form. In secondary I was always shy except when I was around my friends I was as loud as ever. My favourite subject was photography as I loved to create photographs and edit them onto photoshop. In college I did continue to peruse my photography career alongside film where took up an interest of media as I liked the technical side of filming videos and editing them, I did create a short film with my friends to help the prevention of bullying. after college I took a year out to work as I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do with my life as I did enjoy photography and filming I but not peruse this full time. I ended up with a full-time job at JD sports which I continue to do this day I love the job as I love helping customers and love the team I work with. Originally, I did want to do an apprenticeship however I couldn’t find one in the field for creating content for people, which was stressful however when researching media courses, I came across De Mont university where they do media production. Which I did end up applying to study media production which has been fun as I have the had the opportunity to meet new friends and live by myself which has been an experience I will never forget.
